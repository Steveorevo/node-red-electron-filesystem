# node-red-contrib-filesystem
Provides a compact, concise, cross-platform filesystem node allowing for multiple file and
folder operations. The node allows the user to create, copy, move, append, and delete files
as well as list and search names, contents, read, and write. Data can be delivered as an
array or as multiple message output. Multiple outputs and operations work with an optional
current working directory context to help simplify and compact flow operations.

## Examples

#### List & Search Folder Contents

TODO:

#### Create a Folder and File

TODO:

#### Append to Log File


## Installation
Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):

    npm install node-red-contrib-filesystem

The string node will appear in the palette under the storage group.
